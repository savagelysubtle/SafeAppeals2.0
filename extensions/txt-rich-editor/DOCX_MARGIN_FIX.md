# DOCX Margin Rendering Fix

## Problem

DOCX files were not showing proper margins in the editor like TXT files were. The issue was that:

1. **RichTextEditorProvider** (for TXT files) had inline HTML with the margin handling code
2. **DocxEditorProvider** (for DOCX files) was using `generateRibbonHtml()` from `ribbonHtml.ts`
3. The two providers were using different HTML, causing inconsistent margin rendering

## Solution

Unified both providers to use the same `generateRibbonHtml()` function:

### Changes Made

**File: `extensions/txt-rich-editor/src/richTextEditorProvider.ts`**

1. Added import: `import { generateRibbonHtml } from './ribbonHtml';`
2. Simplified `getHtmlForWebview()` method:

```typescript
private getHtmlForWebview(webview: vscode.Webview): string {
    const documentType = this.getDocumentType();
    return generateRibbonHtml(webview, documentType);
}
```

3. Removed ~1700 lines of duplicate inline HTML

## Result

✅ **Both TXT and DOCX files now render with identical margins**
✅ **Unified codebase** - single source of HTML for all file types
✅ **Margin drag handlers work for both** TXT and DOCX
✅ **MarginController integration works consistently** across all file types

## Testing

1. Open a `.txt` file → margins display correctly with drag handles
2. Open a `.docx` file → margins display identically with drag handles
3. Both file types use the same `MarginController` logic
4. DOCX files still extract layout from XML (twips → pixels conversion)

## Compilation

```bash
npx tsc --skipLibCheck --project extensions/txt-rich-editor/tsconfig.json
# Exit code: 0 ✅
```
